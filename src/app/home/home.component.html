  <h1 class="text-3xl mb-4">Hello there!</h1>

  <p class="text-lg">
    I am a master's student in computer science at <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RWTH Aachen University</a>
    and work as a research assistant in the research group <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/">MOVES</a>,
    headed by <a href="https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/people/katoen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Katoen</a>.

  <p class="text-lg mt-4">
    My research interests include the formal verification of probabilistic models, especially those that include uncertainty.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">
    Currently, I'm working on bisimulation techniques to minimize the state space of uncertain probabilistic models such as Interval Markov Chains and
    Interval Markov Decision Processes.
